**ü§ñArtificial Intelligence** 

There‚Äôs going to be something more academic and something that fascinates me. 
I have always had an absurd idea-composing music in a programming language and programming in a music language([~~Maybe we can really try for it~~](https://github.com/AICMUniversity/aria)).

**üéπMusic Theories**

I like to write [some tiny songs](https://fm.jyunko.cn). I have a deep understanding of the expressiveness and emotion of music. I also have a peculiar idea, which is to compose music in a programming language and program in a music language. I think this can create a new connection between music and programming, and also allow music and programming enthusiasts to learn and communicate with each other.
