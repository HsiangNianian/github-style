## psi
Poly-paradigm Scripting Interface

### About
Psi is a concise, lightweight, and extensible scripting language that supports multiple paradigms: scripting, imperative (procedural, prototype-based, object-oriented), functional, contract-based, polymorphic, metaprogramming, stream processing, and event-driven. It is a strongly typed, dynamically-typed language with duck typing dynamics, implemented in Rust.
